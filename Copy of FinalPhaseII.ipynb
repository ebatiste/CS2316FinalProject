I have added a percent discontinued column to put in perspective how much the proportion of products that contain that chemical have been discontinued. It can be inferred that the higher the percent discontinued that the more potentially hazardous a chemical is. I have sorted the data by number of products still sold since the higher up chemicals are of the most importance because they are the most prevalent in cosmetics today. Doing this also indicates that the chemicals located further down on the table are never or rarely sold which can indicate its danger."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mJe4pMRgwuC5","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":497},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605744482791,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":112524,"user":{"displayName":"Etienne
